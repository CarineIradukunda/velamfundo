          Velamfundo is a community learning center that creates learning
          opportunities for people in remote and low income areas. It is located
          in a Zimbabwean village called Mbembesi, largely populated by the Xhosa
          people. Its birth is largely influenced by the founder’s life experiences.
          Read his story below: <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <em id="founder">
            "When I relocated to my home village in 2008 I experienced the struggles
            of learning in rural Africa first-hand. I had to walk a long distance
            to school. This, coupled with an extended list of household chores I
            now had (fetch water from the borehole, cut firewood etc.) greatly
            diminished my study time and worse, I did not have any access to reading
            material at home. Since I was living with my grandmother I had to figure
            out problematic homework exercise on my own. Being a very determined
            learner I managed to endure all this and attained excellent results
            in my final primary school exams. As a result of the rarity of my
            excellent performance in rural schools, I got a scholarship to further
            my education at a prestigious high school. Ever since I graduated from
            high school I have never ceased learning. I’m a self-taught computer
            programmer and I am still learning more about computer science and
            other subjects that interest me. I rely on free university online
            courses to learn, chiefly the UC Berkeley EECS site, and free electronic
            books to further my knowledge and skills. I still live in Mbembesi
            village and this poses significant challenges to my work flow.
            I don’t have reliable internet access. When I go to the city I have
            to download course materials for all courses I intend to take. Also,
            I have to take unwanted breaks to go and charge my laptop at the
            nearest school or clinic. The fact that I’m living in a small village
            with no amenities bars me from accessing quality education. I founded
            Velamfundo to help learners with similar experiences and I also hope
            to benefit from the full implementation of the community learning center.
            I envision a future where rural students do not have to endure walking
            long distances, crossing flooded rivers and the grueling winter cold
            to get to school. A future where a child in the rural areas can just
            wake up and learn something new, make something new and change the world.
            That future is possible, and it starts with Velamfundo and you."

          The opportunity to change the future of rural education is in our hands
        </h3>

        <p>
          The world is changing at unprecedented rates and its problems are becoming
          more complex and the solutions to them more sophisticated. We are indeed
          in the Information Age. This age demands that we have more information
          experts and less common workers. At the heart of grooming experts that
          will take us into the future is a sound education that is accessible to
          all. Remote areas like rural areas are in the shadow region of this global
          development and indeed the education that could help them to develop faster.
          By focusing on delivering quality education opportunities in these areas we
          prepare for a future where the globe is developing at more homogenous rates.
